# Janus

Janus is a sports trading toolset consisting of the following components:

- __jupiter__: Reads a live market data stream and transmits it to other
  components while writing the data for future analysis.
- __neptune__: Converts existing market data JSON to a binary file format for
  efficient analysis by other components.
- __apollo__: Backtesting framework for testing strategies against binary files
  generated by neptune.
- __mars__: Live trading framework that uses jupiter's market data combined with
  strategy code to execute trades in the market.
- __osiris__: GUI giving an insight into what janus is doing and allowing for
  manual/semi-automatic trading.

It is currently only designed to interact with betfair but is designed to be
flexible enough to be portable to other markets.

## Building

Install the following shared components:

* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) - Meta-build system used to generate ninja build files.
* [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja) - Fast build system which can be used with cmake.
* [Google test](https://github.com/google/googletest) - Unit testing framework.
* [clang format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) - Auto code linter/formatter.
* [clang tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) - Static analysis tool.
* [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) - Another static analysis tool.
* [Address sanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) - Memory error detection tool.
* [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) - Fast compressor/decompressor.

After that, simply run `make` in the root directory and binaries should appear in `build/`.

To run tests run `make test`, and to run benchmarks run `make bench`.

## 3rd-party components

* [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) - Fast compressor/decompressor used as a library under a BSD license.

## Additional tools

- __benchmark__: Run 'make bench' to run benchmarks. Currently this just runs
  the original sajson benchmarks.
- __checker__: This allows checking of the JSON parsing and universe update
  applying logic. This is compiled as a tool in the binary 'checker'.
